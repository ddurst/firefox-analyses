# firefox-analyses
A collection of data analyses centered on the front-end of Firefox. This repo contains any analyses that should be repeatable but does not yet have a dashboard.

Spark notebooks, prototype dashboards, and sql queries should be expected. The bigger pain to create, the more reason to check it in here.
